**Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey!**

###Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Antonis Delavogias and I'm on a mission to master JavaScript. I've been diligently studying for the past 3 months and I'm excited to share my progress with you! 

**Current Skills:**

* I've gained a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals like variables, data types, operators, control flow, and functions. 
* I'm comfortable working with DOM manipulation and events to create interactive web pages. 
* I'm constantly expanding my knowledge by exploring more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and asynchronous programming.  

**Completed Courses:**

* [The Odin Project - HTML & CSS] (https://www.connectinglink.com/courses/categories/1-credit-courses) - This course provided a comprehensive introduction to JavaScript and its core concepts.
