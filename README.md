## 🌿 Current Focus  
A clean, structured restart:

- Revisiting **all fundamentals from the beginning** to rebuild a solid base  
- Studying consistently — even when activity isn’t visible online  
- Strengthening **core JavaScript** logic  
- Rebuilding my workflow with modern development practices  
- Creating clean, real-world projects to grow my portfolio  
- Staying disciplined with daily progress  

<br>

## 📚 Currently Learning  
Focused on sharpening essential skills before jumping deeper:

- JavaScript fundamentals (functions, arrays, objects, DOM)  
- Writing clean, readable, maintainable code  
- Problem-solving and logical thinking  
- HTML & CSS structure and responsive design  
- Modern developer tools and workflows  

<br>

## 🎯 What’s Next  
As soon as the foundation is solid again:

- **React** (hooks, components, state management)  
- **Next.js**  
- **TypeScript**  
- Deploying full-stack apps with **Vercel**, **Firebase**, **Supabase**  

<br>
